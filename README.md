### Why am I doing this?

I love Quantum. I have been reading about it at least since 8th grade until I finished my PhD in Quantum Optics and Quantum Information. After that my career somehow led me into ML research. ML Research is fun, but sometimes I get Quantum FOMO. This is me dealing with it and trying to stay current on the quantum.

### Why should you follow this?

I will be exploring the state of the quantum computing industry from the perspective of a Software Engineer.

This will interest you if you -

* are a programmer who wants to learn quantum computing through hands-on coding experience, and/or
* know a bit of quantum physics but not quantum computing, and/or
* used to know quantum physics but need a refresher (like me), and/or
* want to keep up to date with the latest progress in the rapidly evolving quantum computing industry.

If you are none of the above and still find this useful, help me make this site better by telling me your perspective.&#x20;
